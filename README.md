This project is a web-based image classification tool designed to detect Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) using deep learning models. Built with TensorFlow, Keras, and Gradio, the application allows users to upload retina (fundus) images and receive predictions about the severity of DR. A key feature is the model rotator, which alternates between three pre-trained models EfficientNetB0, ResNet50, and MobileNetV2 each time a prediction is made, allowing users to compare performance across models. Uploaded images are preprocessed by resizing, normalizing, and formatting before being passed into the model. The app returns the predicted DR stage (No_DR, Mild, Moderate, Severe, or Proliferative_DR) along with confidence scores. The Gradio interface includes image upload, real-time results, model display, and user interaction buttons like submit and clear. The notebook showcases how different models classify the same image, making it a useful tool for benchmarking, early diagnosis, and experimenting with deep learning models for medical imaging.
